# Introduction
This project is a simulation of [Galton board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine), which visualizes a normal distribution. There are 10 000 balls and 10 bins at the beggining.
The balls are spread across the bins based on normal distribution, this is calculated based on sampling from the uniform distribution.
The Histogram shows the result of one round of normal distribution sampling. Clicking on a bin will set next round with the balls
that are in this bin and histogram will show result of this round of sampling. Clicking on the bin again will set another round.
